## 👋 Hey there!

I’m Shrey Kuvera, a developer based in India.

I build things that make me curious, whether it’s full-stack apps, AI-powered tools, automation workflows, or frontend experiences with clean UI and smooth interactions.
If something sparks my interest, I’ll prototype it, refine it, and ship it.

My main tech stack is React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, and I’ve been diving deeper into Node.js, Express, and AI integrations using modern LLM APIs.
I love working fast, learning faster, and turning ideas into real, usable products.

You’ll find a bunch of my projects pinned below — each one either solved a problem I had or taught me something new.
I’m constantly experimenting, so there’s always something in progress (and way more in private repos than public ones).

I’m currently exploring AI-enhanced development, intelligent automation, full-stack architecture, and building polished UI/UX with modern tooling.

If you want to see how I work (or steal some inspiration 😄), feel free to explore my GitHub.
